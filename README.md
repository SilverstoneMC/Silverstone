### The end of Silverstone Survival
I didn't expect to be writing this anytime soon, but here we are. The end is here. The Silverstone Survival network has been shut down and archived. It's been a fun ~2.5 years, and I'd like to thank everyone for their support. Thank you especially to all those who donated to the server. Thank you to all the @Staff for helping the server to run smoothly and for keeping the players in line. Thank you to everyone who created amazing builds to contribute towards the network. And thank you to @everyone else that supported the server. It's sad to see Silverstone go, but I couldn't be motivated to pay for and maintain a server that often had little to no players online, including myself. I've been increasingly busy with work and school and haven't been able to work on the server in a way that was enjoyable like I had in the past. All good things eventually come to an end, and that end for Silverstone Survival is now.

### Will Silverstone ever return?
Maybe. I don't know what the future holds. Due to the archived state of the server, it wouldn't be hard to get it back up and running, should I have the time and energy to maintain it once again. But for now, all the files have been safely downloaded and stored in the cloud.

Thanks again everyone. Over and out.
